Blog Post 1:

<p>
My first month of college. I have just recently completed my first month of college and am loving it so far. I have made some great friends from my floor and am loving the University I chose! I miss my dog and cat but I've been home twice to visit them! Since I have my car and live only 2 hours away it makes it easy.
