A little bit about myself: I am a freshman at the University of Maine, I am 18 years old. I enjoy skiing in the winter, I grew up skiing at Sugarloaf. My whole family skis. My dad always introduced us to sports that we could participate through our entire lives. This included sports such as tennis, golf, and skiing, sports that we could learn young and keep and use our skills throughout our entire lives. Golf and tennis didn't quite stick with me as much as skiing but both of my brothers play tennis a lot.
